      <h3>New T20I captain named for bangladesh before the tour against UAE,Pakistan</h3>
      <p>Bangladesh appoint Litton Das as T20I captain until T20 World Cup 2026.The BCB chairman revealed that litton has been made the captain keeping the long term vision in mind.
Litton Das will lead the side until the T20 World Cup next year. For Litton, experience has been an important factor. We don't have many experienced players in the current setup. While there were discussions about his form, we believe he has the potential. If he can organize his game, he'll be an asset to the team," BCB Cricket Operation Chairman Najmul Abedin said.Meanwhile, it has also been confirmed that Mahedi Hasan will be the vice-captain of Bangladesh's T20I team for the upcoming series in the UAE and Pakistan. However, he has been picked on the experimentation basis and for now, isn't a permanent appointment. "Mahedi is almost an automatic pick in this format. His tactical awareness stood out to us. But this is not a permanent appointment - just for two series. We want to build a future captain under the guidance of the current one," he said.

"Ahead of the World Cup, we'll have the Asia Cup, and bilateral series against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and India. There will be plenty of chances to experiment. We want to head into the tournament with a performing unit - and Litton will play a key role in that," he said, adding that Litton is expected to take on the No.3 batting position in the T20 lineup, a spot that demands both stability and aggression," BCB Chief Selector Gazi Ashraf Hossain said.

      <h3>Harshitha,Anushka,Nilakshika Takes SL To Thrilling Last-Over Win Against India</h3>
      <p>Veteran Sri Lanka batter Nilakshika Silva struck a counter-attacking 33-ball 56 as the hosts beat India by three wickets in match 4 of the ongoing women's ODI tri-series match in Colombo on Sunday, May 4.

This was Sri Lanka's first victory in seven years against sub-continental rivals India, and their second in the tournament. With that, the Lankans inched closer to the final.

It was India's first loss in the event but they are still expected to make the summit clash thanks to their convincing wins in their first two matches.

Batting first, India posted a competitive 275 for nine riding on aggressive wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh's 48-ball 58. Sri Lanka completed the chase with five balls to spare after slipping to 152 for four in the 33rd over.After Nilakshi flattened the India bowlers with her three sixes and five fours, Anushka Sanjeewani (23 not out off 28 balls) and Sugandika Kumari (19 not out off 20 balls) got the job done for Sri Lanka to push the third team South Africa on the verge of elimination.
